            <h2>Strategic Goals</h2>
            <p>The Allied Strategy: Airborne and Ground Forces
                Operation Market Garden consisted of two coordinated operations:
        
                Operation Market: The airborne assault, involving over 35,000 paratroopers from the U.S. 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and the British 1st Airborne Division,
                tasked with seizing key bridges and holding them until ground forces arrived.
        
                Operation Garden: The ground offensive, led by the British XXX Corps, aimed to advance along the road corridor captured by airborne forces.
                Their objective was to relieve the paratroopers and push into Germany.
        
                Key Battles and Bridge Captures
        
                Eindhoven: The 101st Airborne successfully captured bridges around Eindhoven but faced heavy German counterattacks, delaying their progress.
        
                Nijmegen: The 82nd Airborne Division engaged in fierce combat to seize the Waal River Bridge, resorting to a frontal river crossing under heavy fire.
        
                Arnhem: The British 1st Airborne Division fought to secure the critical bridge over the Rhine. However, they were heavily outnumbered and eventually overwhelmed 
                by German forces.
        
                Challenges and Missteps
                Visitors will learn about the challenges that plagued the operation, including:
        
                Communication failures: Poor radio communication prevented coordination between airborne and ground forces.
        
                Logistical issues: Narrow roads and traffic congestion slowed the advance of XXX Corps.
        
                Underestimated German resistance: The presence of two elite SS Panzer divisions near Arnhem was unexpected, leading to severe Allied casualties.
