            <p> The Immediate Aftermath
                Operation Market Garden was ultimately deemed a tactical failure. The Allies failed to achieve their objectives, and the bridge at Arnhem remained in German hands.
                The failed operation resulted in:
        
                Over 17,000 Allied casualties, including paratroopers and ground forces.
        
                The prolonged occupation of the Netherlands, leading to the “Hunger Winter”, during which thousands of Dutch civilians starved due to food shortages.
        
                A loss of momentum for the Allied advance, allowing German forces to regroup and strengthen their defenses.</p>

                Impact on WWII and Modern Warfare
                Visitors will explore how Market Garden influenced subsequent Allied strategies, including the Battle of the Bulge and the eventual push into Germany.
        
                The campaign highlighted the vulnerabilities of airborne operations and the risks of overextended supply lines.
        
                It also showcased the importance of real-time intelligence, logistical planning, and adaptability in modern warfare.
        
                Commemorations and Memorials
                The website will feature information on memorial sites, museums, and annual commemorations honoring the bravery of the soldiers involved in Operation Market Garden.
        
                The Airborne Museum Hartenstein in Arnhem offers a detailed historical account of the battle.
        
                Annual commemorative events in the Netherlands honor the sacrifices made by Allied forces.</p>
