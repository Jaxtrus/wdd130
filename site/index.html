            <h2>What Was Operation Market Garden?</h2>
            <p>Operation Market Garden was a major Allied military campaign during World War II, launched in September 1944. 
                It was a daring attempt by the Allies to secure key bridges in the Netherlands, break through German defenses, and establish a swift route into northern Germany. 
                The operation was the largest airborne assault of the war and marked one of the most ambitious and controversial campaigns in military history..</p>
